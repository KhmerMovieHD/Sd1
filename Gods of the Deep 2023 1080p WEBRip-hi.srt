1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,141
(arrows whooshing)

2
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,497
(ominous music)

3
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,730
(ocean droning)

4
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:54,295
(ominous music continues)

5
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:02,027
(water sploshing)

6
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,033
(indistinct radio chatter)

7
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,142
(ominous music continues)

8
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:33,127
(phone clicks)

9
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:37,372
(Hazmat Worker) Dr. Goldstein,
Rover 7 made it back

10
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:39,615
to the surface, it seems
to be working.

11
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,963
Everything's been recorded.

12
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:46,208
It can't be left alone.

13
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,523
(ominous music rising)

14
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,746
(celestial music)

15
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:15,342
(button clicks)
(projector whirring)

16
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,557
We found them.

17
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:29,701
(celestial music rising)

18
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,573
(text whirring)

19
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,232
(soft celestial music)

20
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:45,612
Ah, Mr. Peters,

21
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:47,373
there's someone waiting
for you in your office.

22
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:48,409
Waiting for me?

23
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,552
James Peters?

24
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,209
I'm sorry, do I know you?

25
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,107
I'm Dr. Julia Goldstein.

26
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,110
I work for the
Pickman Corporation.

27
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:03,975
(soft celestial music continues)

28
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,770
It's inspiring to see
you've been following

29
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,463
in your father's footsteps.

30
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,292
A researcher.

31
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,121
Must be in the blood.

32
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:13,606
I'm sorry, but I'm
not interested

33
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:16,609
in any more talks or
lectures about my dad.

34
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,576
I've written just about
everything there is to know,

35
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:22,167
so buy my books, I do my
own research now.

36
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:24,238
I know.

37
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,620
The Miskatonic
astrobiology program,

38
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:29,761
partially funded by us.

39
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:33,522
Look, I'm not interested
in any more handouts

40
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,042
from the Pickman Corporation.

41
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:44,084
(sighs) Mr. Peters,
what if I were to tell you

42
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:46,466
that Pickman is
selecting candidates

43
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,330
for some new research?

44
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,539
An expedition.

45
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:52,955
One might say it's an
astrobiologist's

46
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:54,716
dream come true.

47
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:55,717
An expedition?

48
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:59,514
Our teams have been doing
research in the Antarctic

49
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:03,138
and Southern Atlantic oceans
for the past seven years,

50
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,522
until a few months ago when
we found something unexpected.

51
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:10,939
(soft celestial music continues)

52
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,666
(laptop whirrs)

53
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,497
Our team mapped a trench in the
Antarctic continental shelf,

54
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:19,844
west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

55
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:22,709
between South America
and Antarctica.

56
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,541
We've collected over 12,000
square kilometers of data,

57
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:29,440
and we found a new
deepest point in the ocean

58
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,994
of 37,000 feet.

59
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,375
How can that be possible?

60
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:36,275
We knew that the continental
shelf was unusually deep,

61
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,519
but it was something
else, on the ocean floor,

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,385
that, uh, caught us by
surprise, shall we say.

63
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:47,009
(soft celestial music continues)

64
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,702
This is footage from a
remote control sub

65
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,497
we sent down there.

66
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:52,775
What is that?

67
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,949
It looks almost man-made.

68
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:59,954
Well, we have a theory that
it's some kind of portal.

69
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:01,784
To where?

70
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:05,752
That, Mr. Peters, is what
we're going to find out.

71
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:08,998
Pickman wants you to
join the expedition team.

72
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:14,348
I have some people I'd
like you to meet.

73
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:18,593
(text whirring)

74
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:21,768
Thank you, everyone, for
attending at such short notice.

75
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,012
You're finally about to
see why this interruption

76
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:27,809
to your busy lives is
so very worth your time.

77
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,638
I'll make the introductions.

78
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,951
This is Gordon Atkins,

79
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:34,574
head of the manned
submersibles laboratory

80
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:38,647
at London's Royal Society for
Improving Natural Knowledge.

81
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:41,029
Uh, he's agreed to lead
our expedition,

82
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,826
and is by far the most
qualified man for the job.

83
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,449
Christine Harris,
marine biologist

84
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,591
and member of the European
Marine Biology Symposium.

85
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:55,008
James Peters is developing
our discovery programs

86
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,391
at the prestigious
Miskatonic University

87
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:01,049
and is something of an
expert in the field

88
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,570
of Pickman Corp's
early research.

89
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:09,471
Joseph Meeker is our safety
and communications officer.

90
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:13,958
And finally, Hank O'Connell,
our lead engineer.

91
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,029
Hank, the floor is yours.

92
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,687
(soft celestial music)

93
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:19,964
Hello, everyone.

94
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:22,173
I'm really very pleased
to meet you, finally.

95
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,693
I expect you will be wondering
what it is I've engineered.

96
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,419
Through the Pickman Corporation,

97
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,009
my team have managed to build
a deep-diving submersible

98
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,046
like nothing that's ever
existed before.

99
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,290
(button beeps)

100
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,397
This is Providence 3.

101
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:41,848
250 tons, built with
syntactic foam,

102
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,713
capable of withstanding
the huge compressive forces

103
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:48,268
of the water at 37,000
feet and below.

104
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:49,787
Impressive, Hank.

105
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,858
Makes you wonder what happened
to Providence 1 and 2 though.

106
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:54,620
So state of the art
that it can safely

107
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,794
take us into this
ancient opening

108
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:58,659
in the earth's seabed
hydrosphere.

109
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,869
I'm sorry, into the opening?

110
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,802
Didn't you say you sent
remote operated vehicles

111
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,045
in that never came out?

112
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:07,495
Oh, yes, some have made it back.

113
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:08,496
Some?

114
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,532
Listen, we aren't
going to pretend

115
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,741
that this isn't a
risky expedition.

116
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:14,502
We wouldn't launch Providence 3

117
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:18,126
with a crew on board if
we weren't 100% certain

118
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:20,266
our technology was safe.

119
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:21,681
Test dives have been completed

120
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:24,477
with highly satisfying results.

121
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,514
Now all it needs is a crew.

122
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:28,688
What do you expect
us to find down there?

123
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,829
What if there's nothing but
pitch-black, watery abyss?

124
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,178
The ocean is the last
great frontier of our world.

125
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:40,356
(soft celestial music continues)

126
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:48,501
Now, I have dedicated
my whole life

127
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:52,712
to seeking out the unknown and
the incomprehensible,

128
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:56,441
and this gateway might be my
greatest discovery.

129
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:00,927
It demands to be explored,
Ms. Harris.

130
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,344
If something built
that structure,

131
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:07,486
just imagine what might
lie within it.

132
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,110
Secrets of the ocean.

133
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,801
And there is a hidden
world beneath us,

134
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:16,909
gentlemen, ladies, unseen
by human eyes,

135
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,946
because up until now we
have been unable

136
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:24,779
to create the technology
necessary to take us there.

137
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,713
Your mission as the crew
of Providence 3

138
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:31,682
is to be that interface
between our technology

139
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:36,723
and that new dark continent
we aim to explore.

140
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,312
These files contain the
key data collected so far,

141
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,039
and outline the expedition.

142
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:46,214
You'll need to complete
two months of training

143
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,940
before the dive.

144
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,011
Read them closely.

145
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:54,463
You have 24 hours to decide
whether you're in or out.

146
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:58,572
(soft celestial music continues)

147
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,953
James.

148
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,369
I'm so glad you came.

149
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,234
Walt would be so proud to
see us exploring

150
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,925
the unknown together.

151
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:08,962
Thank you, Mr. Pickman.

152
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:11,135
It's a lot to think about.

153
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:15,243
It is, but I wouldn't want
to make this trip without you,

154
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:18,211
it wouldn't seem right,
for Walt's sake.

155
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:19,420
I need you there.

156
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,635
I've been counting down the days

157
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,050
to finally meeting in this crew.

158
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,223
We've worked so hard,

159
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:32,743
overcome so many
challenges to get this far.

160
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:33,951
All right, who wants
another drink?

161
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:35,401
- No.
- Ooh, yes, please.

162
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:36,852
- Yeah? Gotcha.
- Thank you.

163
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,373
Well, I don't think
we'll be eating like this

164
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,582
at the bottom of the ocean,

165
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,860
so I'm gonna enjoy it
while I can.

166
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:47,033
(Hank laughs)

167
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,069
You up for it then?

168
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,622
What, a voyage the deepest part

169
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,451
of the planet
anyone's ever been?

170
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:52,521
How could I walk away from that?

171
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,040
Aah, there's nothing to beat it,

172
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,215
being out there in the deep sea.

173
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:59,598
Firsthand research, it's
what we're born to do, right?

174
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,323
You know, I just,
I can't comprehend

175
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:04,913
the water pressure at
30,000 feet or whatever.

176
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:08,020
Weight of an entire
ocean pressing down on you.

177
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,262
If anything goes wrong.

178
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:11,264
All right, now I'm worried.

179
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:13,094
You now, you're putting
your life in my hands.

180
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,543
Very capable hands, though.

181
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:17,857
Okay, here we go. (groaning)

182
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:20,447
- Cheers, team.
- (Team) Cheers.

183
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:25,106
It's not really what we were
designed to do though, is it?

184
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:28,661
- It sounds risky.
- Ah, expect the unexpected...

185
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,559
First rule of deep
sea exploration.

186
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,941
Wow, well, we'll all sleep
better tonight knowing that.

187
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,254
Thank you, Gordon.

188
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:36,635
You've done this before then?

189
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,396
Ah, many times.

190
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,053
Never this deep though.

191
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:42,641
We'll be setting a new record.

192
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,954
Everything you do is five
times harder in the ocean, okay?

193
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,266
Just remember that.

194
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,682
But you're still going
along with it, all of you?

195
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,028
Well, look, it's like
the old man said,

196
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,721
"It is the chance of
a lifetime."

197
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,378
Well, team, to Providence 3.

198
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,554
(Team) To Providence 3.

199
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:03,144
Guys, I need some fresh
air, I'll be right back.

200
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:04,524
Hm, do you want me to
get you another drink?

201
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,389
No, no, I've had enough, really.

202
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:10,704
Sorry. Ex-excuse me.

203
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,504
(soft celestial music)

204
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:20,956
Hey, you okay?

205
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:25,615
Um, doesn't it scare you at all?

206
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,204
Um, I don't know.

207
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,553
I have this, um,
respect for the ocean.

208
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:34,727
I mean, it's my life,

209
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,662
but I know it can turn
on you in a heartbeat.

210
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:44,185
So you think the others
know who you are, Peters?

211
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:46,497
Or they haven't put two
and two together yet?

212
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,602
So you noticed?

213
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:48,776
Yeah.

214
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:50,916
I mean, obviously I
had to research Pickman

215
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,504
when Dr. Goldstein contacted us,
you know?

216
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,991
See what he's into. His history.

217
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:59,027
What was it like growing up
around something like that?

218
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:01,720
I mean, the stories and,

219
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,344
and the legends,
and all the theories.

220
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,174
I'd rather just
have my dad back.

221
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,176
You mean they really
never found him?

222
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:14,008
That wasn't some hook
just to sell more copies?

223
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:15,355
Gone without a trace.

224
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,770
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:20,773
Hey, it's okay.

226
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,982
Um, it was a long time ago.

227
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:27,469
(soft celestial music continues)

228
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,920
Look, Jim, I don't
think they would

229
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,750
send us down there and
spend all this money

230
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,476
if they weren't certain there
was more for us to discover.

231
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:35,995
What you think there's
something they're

232
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:37,032
not telling us?

233
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:38,584
If I go on this expedition,

234
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:40,587
I need to know that
I'm coming home.

235
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,384
This is my son.

236
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,282
He's, um, he's seven months old,

237
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,975
and I'm all he is got.

238
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,286
My parents are
looking after him.

239
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:52,805
And what's he called?

240
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:53,806
Sam.

241
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:57,292
Uh, look, I, I know what a
huge sacrifice I'll be making.

242
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:59,225
I mean, with the, with
the training and,

243
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:02,090
and the trip, and the time
away from him is gonna kill me,

244
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:05,266
but if everything goes to plan,

245
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:07,614
I'll be back before his
first birthday and...

246
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,513
Maybe I can live with that.

247
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:14,033
And what if it
doesn't go to plan?

248
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,278
Something tells me
these things rarely do.

249
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:21,801

250

252
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:40,371
- Mr. Pickman.
- Thank you.

253
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:53,245
You all ready there, Jim?

254
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:55,281
I can't say I slept
much last night.

255
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:58,077
Just goin' over and over
everything, you know?

256
00:13:58,078 --> 00:13:59,872
Everything that could go wrong.

257
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,047
That's normal, Jim.

258
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:03,945
You know shouldn't
smoke so much, Captain.

259
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:05,533
It increases anxiety
and tension.

260
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:07,017
I like to be tense, dear.

261
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:08,950
It keeps the senses sharp.

262
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:10,849
You wanna ciggy, Jim?
Nah, no thanks.

263
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,369
- You wanna dramamine?
- Ooh, you have some?

264
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,925
Hey, uh, how far are we goin'?

265
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,203
(Hank) You'll see.

266
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,688

How long?

276
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,431
We are launching in one hour.

Okay, team, let's go, go, go!

bottom of the ocean,</i>

323
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,127
we're feeling pretty
great about it.

324
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,786
(soft celestial music)

325
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:20,512
Okay, Mr. Pickman?

326
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:22,618
More than okay.

327
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:25,966
She's remarkable.

328
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:31,627
(ladder thudding)

329
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:41,947
(hatch clanking)

330
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:46,055
(soft celestial music continues)

331
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:55,719
Hatch is secure, Captain.

332
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,825
Roger that, Hank.

333
00:18:58,413 --> 00:18:59,758
(console beeps)

334
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,798
Be advised, we are in position
and go for launch ops.

335
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,386
Three minutes to commence
launch operation, over

336
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,217
Roger that, DP control.

337
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,047
I'm gonna open the vent.

338
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,049
We are clear to vent.

339
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,085
Opening now.

340
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:19,881
(soft celestial music rising)

341
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:22,194
(submersible droning)

342
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,266
(submersible rumbling)

343
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:28,235
(monitors beeping)

344
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:32,378
(submersible rumbling continues)

345
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:39,626
(soft celestial music rising)

(soft suspenseful music)

348
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:51,223
Don't worry.

349
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,121
If it buckles, the
whole thing will implode

350
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,709
at hypersonic speed,

351
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,298
and we'll be jelly in a
matter of micro seconds.

352
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,335
What?

353
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:01,130
You won't have time to
even know it's happened.

354
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,620
(door hissing)

355
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,901
(lights clacking)

356
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:17,940
(soft suspenseful music rising)

357
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:22,082
(equipment beeps)

358
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:30,642
Pre-dive safety briefing's
already completed.

359
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:32,747
(Rachel) <i>All right, P3,
let's do final checks.</i>

360
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,162
(Gordon) Final checks.

361
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:37,821
Vision one, CO2 is
running at 0.3%.

362
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,616
Scrubber fan is running.

363
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,031
Depth gauge is working.

364
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,481
Compass is working.

365
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:45,070
Okay, and I think we're ready.

366
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,486
DP control, we are
clear to launch.

367
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,625
Affirmative.

368
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,110
Good luck on your
voyage to the deep, P3.

369
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:52,872
You have permission to dive.

370
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,080
<i>Copy that.</i>

371
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,254
Heading down.

372
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,291
(submersible rumbling)
(suspenseful music)

373
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,260
Say goodbye to the
surface world.

374
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:07,507
(submersible droning)
(soft celestial music)

375
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,373
Approaching 20 meters.

376
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:14,479
Vents are secure.

377
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,514
40 Meters.

378
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:18,552
(submersible droning)

379
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:20,070
P3, what's your speed?

380
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,383
Vertical speed, 3.4 knots.

381
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:24,696
I have good control.

382
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:25,800
Copy that.

383
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,975
We're losing light already.

384
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:29,494
Approaching 100 meters.

385
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:31,461
Okay, team, good job.

386
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,014
Right on course.

387
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:35,396
(soft suspenseful music)

388
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:38,607
(submersible droning)

389
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,647
10,500 meters.

390
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:46,338
Five minutes 'til target depth.

391
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,515
In 400 meters, we've
set a new record.

392
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,967
(alarm wailing)
(air hissing)

393
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:56,762
The pressure lock.

394
00:21:56,763 --> 00:22:00,042
(soft celestial music)

395
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,223
Once the rover is fully
submerged, we seal you in.

396
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:10,881
Then we activate the exit doors.

397
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:16,093
(chains clattering)

398
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:19,440
Then, you're on your
own out there,

399
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:21,373
ready to explore the deep.

400
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,755
Just remember you're training.

401
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:24,791
Piece of cake.

402
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:26,965
Hank! Jim!

403
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:29,036
You need to come see this.

404
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:32,351
(soft celestial music)

405
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:38,045
- What is it?
- Turn up front spotlight.

406
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:39,874
(button beeps)

407
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,876
Are you ready to see
this in person?

408
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:43,050
We're here already?

409
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:44,638
X coordinates minus 106,

410
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:46,950
Y coordinates minus 79.

411
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:50,195
DP control, we have arrived.

412
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:52,749
(switch clicks)
(light thuds)

413
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,615
(soft celestial music continues)

414
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:59,826
(submersible droning)

415
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,798
(Rachel) <i>Just keep talking, P3.</i>

416
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,318
We're looking at a
huge carbonate structure,

417
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,390
a circular gateway.

418
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,391
It's unreal.

419
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,047
Yeah, planet earth's butthole,

420
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:16,428
just where I wanna be.

421
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,811
No volcanic activity
causes this kind of detail.

422
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,088
These rocks were put here.

423
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:23,884
By what? They're the
size of houses.

424
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:25,506
All I know is that this
place will teach us more

425
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,128
than we've ever dreamed.

426
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:30,305
I'm easing us into the gateway.

427
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:34,516
<i>Speed is 2.3 knots.</i>

428
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,622
Spotlights are facing forward,

429
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:42,143
but we're just headed
into absolute darkness.

430
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:43,662
P3, you must keep talking to us

431
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:45,077
as you move into the gateway.

432
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:46,838
The signal is currently
running at 100%.

433
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,495
Everything's stable.

434
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:50,600
Picture is all good on
front and rear cams.

435
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,533
We're loud and clear.

436
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:57,089
(soft celestial music continues)

437
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,058

438
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:09,309

441
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:26,291
Gordon!

00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:28,569
- (Rachel) <i>P3?</i>
- Everything's shutting down!

443
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,570
What's going on down there?

444
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,847
I've lost thrusters.

445
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,711
Hank!
P3, come in.

446
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:33,781
We're losing them.

447
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:35,162
Try to get a better signal.

448
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:37,129
I am trying.

449
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,996
(creature screeching)
(suspenseful music)

450
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,515
Activate emergency power!

00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,386
Come in, DP control!

454
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:54,215
Rachel, can you hear us?

455
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:55,389
DP...
We've lost them!

456
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,288
Hey, everybody just cool it,
all right?

457
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,808
Gordon, are the thrusters
still malfunctioning?

458
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:01,913
It's everything, Hank.

459
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,604
Everything has shut down.

460
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:05,399
We're still sinking.

461
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,194
Depth is approaching
1100 meters.

462
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,747
I'm dropping our weights,
we can't just sit here.

463
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:11,129
- No, no, stop. Stop!
- Hang on, Gordon, not yet.

464
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,164
Give it a chance.

465
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:13,441
Remember where we are?

466
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:14,478
We made it.

467
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:17,170
- I've gotta find Pickman.
- Wait.

468
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,621
Take this.

469
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:26,732
I guess we're on our own
down here then.

470
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:31,150
(submersible droning)

471
00:25:32,358 --> 00:25:35,602
Jesus, Pickman!
(music jolts)

472
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,742
We found them.

479
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,413

480
00:25:54,414 --> 00:25:55,449
<i>It looks like we lost power</i>

481

when we entered the portal.

482
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,590
We've definitely stumbled
on something here.

483

<i>Three hours of radio silence,</i>

How long did you say
we were out of contact?

488
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,396
<i>Three hours and 12 minutes</i>

489
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:13,260
since your last transmission,
P3.

490
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:14,399
That's impossible.

491
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,988
Hank, check our life support.

492
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,923
(soft tense music)

493
00:26:21,303 --> 00:26:23,028
(keypad beeping)

494
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,998
Life support has decreased
approximately three hours.

495
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,483
She's right.
What does that mean?

496
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:31,450
(Cameron) <i>We're not
getting anything up here, P3.</i>

497
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,451
There's disruption on the feed,

498
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,315
a lot of static interference.

499
00:26:34,316 --> 00:26:35,283
Oh my God.

500
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:38,837
(soft celestial continues)

501
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:40,529
Describe what we're looking at.

502
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:43,290
Uh, okay.

503
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,603
Um, I hope you can hear me
clearly enough.

504
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,502
<i>We're, (breathes deeply)
we're drifting above</i>

505
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:51,161
a huge ancient ruin.

506
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:54,853
There are decayed stone
structures as,

507
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:57,167
as big as mountains.

508
00:26:58,064 --> 00:26:59,893
How could there have
ever been life down here?

509
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:01,791
Sunlight could have
never reached this place.

510
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,828
That implies a whole
new basis of life.

511
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:06,624
One that doesn't need the sun,
only water.

512
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,797
And darkness.

513
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:09,628
Maybe it wasn't
always underwater.

514
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:13,251
There's something on the seabed.

515
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:15,702
- (Christine) What is that?
- Uh, maneuver the camera.

516
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:17,117
(stammers) Pan, pan down.

517
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:19,084
Get a better view of it.

518
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:24,125
(camera whirring)
(soft celestial music)

519
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:28,163
Rachel, are you seeing this?

520
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:31,338
I think I'm getting something.

521
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:32,374
Look.

522
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:36,723
Fuck!

523
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:41,555
That looks like some kind
of life form, doesn't it?

524
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:42,590
Copy that.

525
00:27:42,591 --> 00:27:43,937
Impossible.

526
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:45,455
It's definitely some
sort of remains,

527
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,735
buried under centuries
of sediment buildup.

528
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:50,529
I want to get a
closer look at that.

529
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,117
Where is Mr. Peters?

530
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:53,154
He's right here.

531
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:56,536
Peters.

532
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:58,503
James, I need a tissue sample

533
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:02,507
from that deep sea organism,
whatever it is, understood?

534
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:03,474
Copy that.

535
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:07,582
(soft celestial music continues)

536
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,379
This is the payoff.

537
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:15,900
The answer to our
deepest wonders.

538
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:19,489
<i>So many secrets we must know.</i>

539
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,665
It's on you, Jim.

540
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:27,844
(submersible droning)

541
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:32,262
(chain clanking)

542
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:47,449
(water sploshing)
(Jim exhales sharply)

543
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:56,009
Are you gonna be all right?

544
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,596
Yeah.

545
00:28:57,597 --> 00:29:00,152
(air hissing)

546
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:03,845
(water sploshing)

547
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,368
(Jim breathing heavily)

548
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:13,165
(chain clanking)

549
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:19,377
(switch clicks)
(console blips)

550
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,897
I'll be all right.

551
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:23,415
(Hank) Repressurizing lock.

552
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,624
Brace for launch, Jim

553
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:29,180
(alarm buzzing)
(air hissing)

554
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:34,220
(chains clanking)
(alarm wailing)

555
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:37,845
(ominous music)

556
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:42,332
(rover droning)

557
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,611
(chains clanking)
(door creaking)

558
00:29:46,612 --> 00:29:48,407
(door thuds)

559
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:51,823
(alarm buzzing)
Rover clear for launch.

560
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:54,515
Opening pressure lock
outer doors...

561
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:55,483
Now.

562
00:29:55,484 --> 00:30:00,418
(doors whirring)
(rover droning)

563
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,178
(Hank) Launch successful.

564
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:03,215
You okay?

565
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:06,114
Just don't let anything
happen to him out there.

566
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:08,875
Jim, are you receiving?

567
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,705
(Jim) <i>Life support's all good.</i>

568
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:13,327
There is more current
down here than I expected,

569
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,433
but I've got good control.

570
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:18,022
Okay, take her down.

571
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:19,713
<i>All lights facing down.</i>

572
00:30:19,714 --> 00:30:23,028
Increasing vertical
speed to 1.4 knots.

573
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,201
You doing good, Jim.

574
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:26,651
38,000 feet.

575
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:30,862
Oh, man, it feels pretty
lonely out here right now.

576
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,002
We're right here with you, Jim.

577
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:37,213
(chains clanking)
(ominous music)

578
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:39,733
Guys, are you seein' this?

579
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:43,255
(dramatic music)

580
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:48,880
We have a clear image
from all rover cams.

581
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,226
Gently now.

582
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:52,021
(Jim) <i>300 units of down thrust.</i>

583
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:55,128
Take it easy, Jim, you're
right on top of that thing.

584
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:57,164
Look at that creature.

585
00:30:57,165 --> 00:31:00,065
(celestial music)

586
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:06,933
Gordon, what was this?

587
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:09,901
(Gordon) Starboard 20
degrees and ease her down.

588
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:12,697
(Jim) Whatever this
thing was, it's colossal.

589
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:13,801
<i>Up close, could have
been as tall</i>

590
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:14,975
<i>as the Empire State Building.</i>

591
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:17,288
Okay, Jim, you can't
afford to waste much time.

592
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:19,359
Get the tissue sample,
get the hell out of there.

593
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,326
Affirmative. I'm in position.

594
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:22,672
His depth gauge isn't
reading anything,

595
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,053
should we be worried?

596
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:26,987
(Joe) We haven't got time
to worry. He's doing fine.

597
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:29,369
(rover whirring)

598
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,198
(Gordon) <i>Nice and easy.</i>

599
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:33,925
Oh, Jesus, it's like
whale blubber.

600
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,754
Looks like some sort
of cephalopod.

601
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:40,621
Deep-sea gigantism on
an epic scale.

602
00:31:40,622 --> 00:31:43,417
I can't understand how
it hasn't deteriorated.

603
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,937
Maybe the dissolved
oxygen levels down here?

604
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,939
Makes you wonder how
long it's been dead.

605
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,354
(celestial music jolts)

606
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:51,322
Guys, check out rear cams,
something moving out there.

607
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:52,806
- Moving?
- You didn't see it?

608
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:54,808
I've almost finished
the incision.

609
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:55,947
I can't see shit out here.

610
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,121
Gordon, I'm picking up movement.

611
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:59,744
Impossible, nothing
could be alive down here.

612
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:01,332
- It's reading a life-form.
- It's reading Jim.

613
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,643
This is too big to be
Jim, this is massive!

614
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:03,955
Well, then it's reading wrong.

615
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,543
Everything's glitching
since we entered the portal.

616
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:06,958
- Jim needs...
- We don't say anything

617
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,546
until he's got the
sample, he's nearly there.

618
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:09,754
He might be in danger!

619
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:11,238
One more minute and
he has got the sample!

620
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,378
He might not have a minute!
Let me talk to him!

621
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:14,621
- Stop!
- The corporation did

622
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:16,209
not spend all of this money

623
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,520
for us to come back
with nothing!

624
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:18,833
Let Jim do his job!

625
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,593
(Jim) <i>All right, guys,
I got it, I got it.</i>

626
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:22,594
Okay, Jim.

627
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:23,458
Gordon, please get
him out there.

628
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:24,838
Is the sample secure, Jim?

629
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,150
Just a little longer.

630
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:27,392
The sample is secure,

631
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:29,670
but I've lost my starboard
horizontal thruster.

632
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:32,535
Guys, I've got a lot of
failures here.

633
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:33,571
<i>This isn't looking good.</i>

634
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:35,987
Don't panic, Jim.
(alarm buzzing)

635
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,402
Jim, please respond!

636
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:39,370
He's not hearing us.

637
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:40,612
(grunts) Signal's gone.

638
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:41,993
Hello? Gordon?

639
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:45,445
(ominous music)
(creature howling)

640
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:48,413
(ominous music jolts)
(submersible rumbling)

641
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:50,001
It's moving again,
whatever it is.

642
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:52,003
(Walt) <i>We've just lost
communication</i>

643
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,453
<i>with port (indistinct).</i>

644
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:57,146
<i>Something's scrambling
our radios out there.</i>

645
00:32:57,147 --> 00:32:58,837

00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:09,089
- Don't lose him!
- What the fuck is that?

650
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,297
(Gordon) I'm not
going any closer.

651
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:11,402
We're not leaving without Jim!

652
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:12,782
Take us down!
Are you insane?

653
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,716
(creature screeching)

654
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:19,720
(door hissing)
(alarm buzzing)

655
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:23,655
(Creature) This is
what you wanted, Pickman,

656
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:26,349
an encounter with the Gods?

657
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:31,180
Aren't they as
immeasurable as you recall?

658
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:34,011
(Gordon) DP control,
permission to abort.

659
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,529
(Julia) <i>Permission denied,
Atkins.</i>

660
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,911
Retrieve that rover before
you begin your ascent.

661
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:40,224
Are you not seeing this?

662
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:41,708
Permission to abort!

663
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,606
Permission denied, Gordon.

664
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,850
I'm not losing that sample.

665

(creature screeching)

667
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:54,238
Hank, fill the pressure lock,

668
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:56,448
we're bringing him in now.

669
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:59,036
(creature screeching)

670

672
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:05,559
- Argh!
- Gordon, take us down!

673
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,629
What is that?

674
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,080
Goddamn it, Gordon,
take us down!

675
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:10,082
Get out!

676
00:34:11,325 --> 00:34:12,428
No!

677
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,498
I'm taking us down.

678
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:16,053
No, we're too close!

679
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:16,985
Fuck!

680
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:19,849

(sparks crackling)
(submersible rumbling)

683
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,442
(Christine) Hank, help me!

684
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:27,650
Christine! (grunts)

685
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:30,584
(door thuds)
(creature howling)

686
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:31,585

(creature howling)

692
00:34:43,943 --> 00:34:45,806
P3, my thrusters are back.

693
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:47,705
Your air supply is
not looking good,

694
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:49,914
get as close to us as you can!

695
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:51,088
We gotta move!

696
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,917

Gordon, I'm heading back!

700
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:01,788
Jim, prepare to board.

701
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:03,411
No, no, stop!

702
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,344
Gordon, stop!

703
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:08,691
Don't open the outer doors!

704
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,935
(suspenseful music continues)
(rover droning)

705
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:12,764
Christine! She's in the
pressure dock!

706
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:14,525
- What?
- She's in the water.

707
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:15,698
Open up the inner doors,
the inner door!

708
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,286
(Gordon) <i>There isn't time!</i>

709
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:18,701
You'll blast her into the ocean!

710
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:22,015
She'll die, Gordon! (grunts)

711
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:24,362
Jim, you'll have to hang on.

712

(suspenseful music continues)

713
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:29,057
Christine ah, I'm coming.

(alarm buzzing)

715
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,130
Hurry up!

(suspenseful music)

720
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:52,080
No.
No, no.

721
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,737
Come on, gimme a hand!

722
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,430
Help me get her out!

723
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:59,225
Gordon, the doors
aren't opening.

724

(creature wailing
and screeching)

725
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:02,883
Gordon, I'm outside.

726
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:05,576
Jim, hang in there,
we've got a problem!

727
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:07,336
Chris is trapped in the
pressure lock!

728
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:08,406
- What?
<i>- You'll have to wait</i>

729
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:09,856
for the pressure lock to reseal!

730
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:11,444
I can't let you in!

731

(alarm buzzing)
(suspenseful music continues)

732

- Christine!
- Hank, quick,

733
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:17,415
Pull her out.
All right.

734

- That's it, grab it.
- Pull up.

741
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:35,053
Come on, quick. Quick.

742
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:40,094
(both grunting)
(suspenseful music)

743
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:44,718
All right, Joe, help her.

744
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,203
Help her? She's fucking dead!

745
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,689
Well do something, you're
the fucking safety officer!

746
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:53,140
Gordon, I'm closing the

(Gordon) Hank, we're
taking on water!

756
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,184
The front end is compromised!

757
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:39,428
Hank, what's going
on down there?

758
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,327
Hank!

759
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:42,673
Gordon, I think we lost her.

760
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:45,089
Never mind that, Hank.
Check the bunk rooms.

761
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,678
I'm reading severe
damage down there.

762
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,162
This whole sub is gonna go down

763
00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:51,302
if I don't drop weight now!

(suspenseful music)
(door hissing)

765

Jim, I'm opening the
outer doors.

00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:58,309
Hold on, I'm getting
into position.

(water pattering)
(Hank grunting)

779
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,997
Gordon, the entire bunk
room's flooded.

780
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:32,688
I'm sealing off this corridor.

781
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:35,967
Drop weights now or the
water will drag us down!

782
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:38,107
The pressure doors are
still closing.

783
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,040
Jim's in there!

784
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,904
We don't have time, Gordon!

785
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,149
And we, we can't ascend with
this much water on board!

786
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,358
Gordon!
Five seconds, Hank!

787
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,429
We can wait five seconds!

(suspenseful music continues)
(alarm blaring continues)

789
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,435
It's too late, Jim,
I'm dropping weights.

790
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:56,403
Hold on!

at X minus 278, Y minus 78!

801

Is it following you, Gordon?

I don't know! Check the radar!

Ugh, I can't get out.

811
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:53,079
Look at it, Hank.

812

Look at the devastation
they can cause.

813
00:39:56,842 --> 00:40:00,397
Just one of them
against all of us.

814
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,710
- What?
- Our brilliant minds,

815
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:06,093
totally defenseless
against them.

816
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,302
What are talking about?

817
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:12,581
They're brilliant, Hank, brilliant.

818
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:15,135
(Hank moaning)

819
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:20,140
(alarm blaring continues)
(suspenseful music continues)

820
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:23,489
(water burbling)

821
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:27,114
(suspenseful music rising)

822
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:29,219
No! No!

823
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,359
(ominous music)

824
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,914
No, no, no, no, no!

825
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,226
Why won't you help her?
(Joe whimpering)

826
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,470
Why won't you help, dammit?

827
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,507
(soft music)

828
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:43,819
Jesus, no.

829
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,820
No!

830
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:46,270
(Jim grunting)
(palms thudding)

831
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:47,616
Come on, Chris.

832
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:50,964
Come on, don't fucking leave
me down here without you.

833
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,345
Come on, please.

834
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:55,591
(soft music continues)

835
00:40:57,316 --> 00:40:59,145
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

836
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:01,458
Come on. Fuck.

837
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,736
Please, Chris. Please.

838
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:05,565
Come on. Come on.

839
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:06,739
Breathe, dammit.

840
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,292
Breathe!

841
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:09,569
Come on, Chris.

842
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,502
Come on.

843
00:41:10,503 --> 00:41:14,092
(Jim grunting and panting)

844
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:18,785
Fuck.

845
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,925
(Jim panting)
(palms thudding)

846
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:22,133
Come on.

847
00:41:22,134 --> 00:41:24,204
Come on, come on, just breathe.

848
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:25,309
Just breathe!

849
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,517
(Christine gagging)

850
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:27,967
You're all right.
You're all right.

851
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:32,868
You're all right. (panting)

852
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:34,352
(Christine) Jim!

853
00:41:34,353 --> 00:41:36,493
(both panting)

854
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,772
You're all right.

855
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:42,947
(Joe whimpering)

856
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:47,988
(Jim panting)
(Christine sobbing)

857
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:57,549
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

858
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,551
It's okay, we made it.

859
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:03,348
(both shivering)

860
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:08,008
It's okay. It's okay.

861
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:16,188
(submersible droning)

862
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:24,575
Hey.
Yeah, thanks.

863
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,163
(ominous music)

864
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:28,406
(door hissing)

865
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:30,236
O'Connell's dead.

866
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:31,582
See for yourself if you want to,

867
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,342
he's floating in
between the doors.

868
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,380
The whole front of the
sub is underwater.

869
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:37,347
Are you sure?

870
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,245
Well, unless he went for a swim.

871
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:38,970
Well, you thought
Chris was dead,

872
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:40,591
look how that turned out.

873
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,593
Hey, I'm not the one who fell
into the fucking pressure lock.

874
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,630
She wasn't breathing,
how was I to know?

875
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:46,217
That we should all
just be grateful

876
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:47,598
that any of us are still alive.

877
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,599
Fuck!

878
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,395
(ominous music continues)

879
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:53,259
How long till we're back
on the surface, Gordon?

880
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,125
(lighter rasping)

881
00:42:58,196 --> 00:43:01,405
Well, kids, can't say for sure.

882
00:43:01,406 --> 00:43:03,303
We've taken on a fuck
ton of water.

883
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,996
Hank said not to smoke in here.

884
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:08,275
Do you want one, Jim?

885
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:11,242
Help yourself.

886
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:13,417
We'll smoke in his memory.

887
00:43:13,418 --> 00:43:15,695
(soft anxious music)

888
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:17,733
How long can we survive
like this down here?

889
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:22,529
We've got three more
hours of life support left.

890
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,393
Can't see it taking us
more than two hours

891
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,292
to get to the surface.

892
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,087
But I can't be sure.

893
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:30,537
The longer we're down
here, the heavier we get,

894
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:32,401
the slower we ascend.

895
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:33,540
Three hours seems tight.

896
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,059
It is tight,

897
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,924
but there's nothing
more I can do about it.

898
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:40,202
Let's hope there's no
more nasty surprises.

899
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:45,243
(metal clanks)
(obscure music)

900
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:47,244
(container thuds)

901
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:48,660
It's the tissue sample.

902
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,732
(ooze squelching)

903
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:55,355
(door hissing)

904
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:59,566
(obscure music continues)

905
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:01,568
Do you hear them, Jim?

906
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:03,950
Calling to us...

907
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:05,918
God's of the deep...

908
00:44:05,919 --> 00:44:09,335
Howling to be perceived
by human minds.

909
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:12,063
(ominous music)

910
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,690
This tiny specimen,

911
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:22,348
it's going to change
everything we know.

912
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:24,903
Everything we ever
thought we knew.

913
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:27,388
Don't touch it.

914
00:44:28,562 --> 00:44:31,115
We need to get this down
to the lab and isolate it.

915
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:33,946
Quickly now, before it
deteriorates.

916
00:44:33,947 --> 00:44:35,672
Maybe we should seal
it in the pressure lock.

917
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,605
No, I want this preserved
properly in the lab.

918
00:44:38,606 --> 00:44:40,677
Pickman, this is something
that hasn't been out

919
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,058
of the water for
millions of years,

920
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:44,957
we have no idea what
we're exposing ourselves

921
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:46,372
to by bringing this on board.

922
00:44:46,373 --> 00:44:49,099
Ms. Harris, do you
really think you came

923
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,689
all the way down here
just to look at it?

924
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,863
We didn't know we were
collecting living tissue.

925
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:58,315
So many answers await us, Jim.

926
00:44:58,316 --> 00:45:00,593
I don't have time to waste.

927
00:45:00,594 --> 00:45:03,872
(metal clanking)
(ominous music continues)

928
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:05,874
(container rasps)
(air hissing)

929
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,913
(tissue squelching)

930
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:14,193
Careful, Joseph.

931
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:17,715
(ominous music continues)

932
00:45:25,032 --> 00:45:26,170
Where you going?

933
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:28,034
We can't stop them
examining that thing,

934
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:29,104
so someone who knows
what they're doing

935
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:30,105
should go supervise,

936
00:45:30,106 --> 00:45:31,729
make sure they keep
it contained.

937
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:35,801
(door hissing)

938
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:37,561
Three hours, Jim.

939
00:45:37,562 --> 00:45:38,631
I suggest you go with them

940
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:40,392
and make sure they do
nothing stupid.

941
00:45:41,566 --> 00:45:43,602
I've not seen Pickman
like this since...

942
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:46,432
A long time.

943
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:48,123
He's not thinking straight.

944
00:45:48,124 --> 00:45:50,161
I don't know if any of
us are anymore.

945
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:57,132
(submersible droning)

946
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:58,616
(Gordon) <i>DP control,</i>

947
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,135
we are a little
under three hours

948
00:46:00,136 --> 00:46:01,619
from the surface.

949
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,243
The tissue sample is
securely aboard.

950
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:05,693
We've got one casualty.

951
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:08,834
<i>O'Connell didn't make it.</i>

952
00:46:08,835 --> 00:46:13,666
(obscure music)
(air hissing)

953
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:18,257
It seems like it's
mostly adipose tissue.

954
00:46:18,258 --> 00:46:19,604
(Christine) Body fat.

955
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:22,364
This is a big piece you took.

956
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:23,434
Yeah, no surprise it tried

957
00:46:23,435 --> 00:46:25,334
to knock us halfway
across the ocean.

958
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:29,994
Totally disconnected
from the body...

959
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:33,894
But still reactive.

960
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:38,277
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like it.

961
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:41,383
Imagine what we could learn
from an organism like this.

962
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:42,488
The flesh that still lives on

963
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,628
after it's been severed
from the body.

964
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:48,219
Oh, it still thinks it's
part of the sea beast.

965
00:46:49,565 --> 00:46:51,842
I think that it senses us.

966
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,188
And I say we leave it
the hell alone

967
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:55,812
and wait 'til it's safely
back at the research base.

968
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,608
Hank built this so we
could do immediate research.

969
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,334
Well, unexpected things
happen when we mess

970
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:02,749
with stuff we don't understand.

971
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,925
And how do you know this
thing will still be moving,

972
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:09,515
active, secreting
slime like it is

973
00:47:09,516 --> 00:47:11,206
once we get it back
to the surface?

974
00:47:11,207 --> 00:47:12,345
Guys.

975
00:47:12,346 --> 00:47:14,140
If you don't mind,
I'll take my chances.

976
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:15,141

Chris, get away from it.

982
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:35,576
It knows we're here.

983
00:47:36,612 --> 00:47:37,854
Can't we freeze it?

984
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,891
(Joe) I think we pissed
it off enough already.

985
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:43,826
Pickman, Jim's right.

986
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:46,863
We need to keep this contained.
We should seal the lab,

987
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,278
we have no idea what
we're dealing with.

988
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,452
I'm paying you to be the
biologist here.

989
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:53,662
I am not risking someone
else's life for this expedition.

990
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,079
The science trip is over.

991
00:47:56,735 --> 00:47:59,876
Jim, get him out of here and
help me lock this place up.

Dr. Goldstein.

1008
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:12,465
<i>Joseph, tell me the
specimen is secure.</i>

1009
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,364
It's been contained in
the onboard lab,

1010
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:16,435
Pickman's already running tests.

1011
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:17,608
I think you're gonna be
very satisfied.

1012
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:19,127
<i>I hope so.</i>

1013
00:49:19,128 --> 00:49:22,199
<i>Don't underestimate the
value of that tissue sample,</i>

1014
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,374
<i>protect it with your life,</i>

1015
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,410
<i>because if it doesn't make
it back to the surface...</i>

1016
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:29,068
Lady, if that sample doesn't
make it back, neither do I.

1017
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:30,345
And believe me,

1018
00:49:30,346 --> 00:49:32,554
that tuna chunk will be
the least of my worries.

1019
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:33,831
<i>You don't have to worry.</i>

1020
00:49:33,832 --> 00:49:36,869
<i>As long as that specimen
is delivered to me,</i>

1021
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,044
<i>your safety is guaranteed.</i>

1022
00:49:39,045 --> 00:49:40,148
And the deal's the
same as before.

1023
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:41,253
<i>Correct.</i>

1024
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:44,187
Well then, we are
crystal clear, babe.

1025
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:46,154
And I'm already taking
the necessary precautions.

1026
00:49:46,155 --> 00:49:48,570
(gun snaps)

1027
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:49,847
Pickman's gonna be pissed.

1028
00:49:49,848 --> 00:49:52,574
<i>Pickman isn't
interested in riches.</i>

1029
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:55,130
Well then, his loss is our gain.

Something's not right here,
Chris.

1045
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:38,818
There's some strange feeling...

1046
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:39,923
I don't know.

1047
00:51:39,924 --> 00:51:42,891
Just try to relax,
it's nearly over.

1048
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:43,961
We've been down here God
knows how long,

1049
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:45,135
and no one's ever
been this deep.

1050
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:46,930
Yeah, but maybe we were
never meant to come here.

1051
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:49,588
You know, maybe nature never
intended us to find this place.

1052
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:51,935
Don't get hysterical on me, Jim.

1053
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:53,385
Have you seen
anything down here?

1054
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:54,903
You know, heard anything?

1055
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:56,767
Things you shouldn't see,
things that couldn't be here?

1056
00:51:56,768 --> 00:51:57,768
Like what?

1057
00:51:57,769 --> 00:51:58,907
None of this was
meant to be here.

1058
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,012
Well, like when you went
into the water,

1059
00:52:00,013 --> 00:52:01,427
why did you do that?

1060
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:02,635
Because you saw something, right?

1061
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:03,740
Something made you do it?

1062
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:04,707
No, I fell.

1063
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:05,776
No, you saw something,

1064
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:07,330
you, you, you chased after it,

1065
00:52:07,331 --> 00:52:09,332
like, like Sam floating
in the water.

1066
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,782
No. Jim, what's
wrong with you?

1067
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:14,026
Look, when I was out there,

1068
00:52:14,027 --> 00:52:16,580
I thought I heard my
dad over the intercom.

1069
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:18,134
His tapes, his, his
old recordings,

1070
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,514
they were playing at the
bottom of the fucking ocean.

1071
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:20,757
How can that be possible?

1072
00:52:20,758 --> 00:52:24,001
Listen to me, you didn't
hear anything, okay?

1073
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:24,934
You panicked.

1074
00:52:24,935 --> 00:52:26,350
We're all shocked. It's normal.

1075
00:52:27,454 --> 00:52:29,353
I don't think any of
this is normal.

1076
00:52:30,595 --> 00:52:32,389
I just know I wanna get home.

1077
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,600
We will, but I need you
to keep it together, okay?

1078
00:52:38,016 --> 00:52:39,017
I need you.

1079
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,573
Help keep me sane until
we're back on the surface.

1080
00:52:43,436 --> 00:52:44,506
I can't do this alone.

1081
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:47,474
We came to the bottom
of the ocean,

1082
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,408
none of us were ever
entirely sane.

(soft music continues)

1084
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:57,242
You did great out there.

1085
00:52:57,243 --> 00:52:59,209
Your dad could never bring
back this physical proof

1086
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,454
of things that people
didn't believe existed.

1087
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,284
This is gonna shock the world,
Jim.

1088
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:06,804
You lived up to your name.

1089
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:10,256
Yeah, well...

1090
00:53:11,498 --> 00:53:13,466
I worry that might not
be a good thing.

1091
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:19,505
We're two hours
from the surface.

00:55:38,645 --> 00:55:39,681
Come on!

1138
00:55:40,785 --> 00:55:42,199
Put down the ax, Jim!

1139
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,167
Pickman's in there!

1140
00:55:43,168 --> 00:55:44,374
(Joe) That's Pickman's problem.

1141
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,065
You're not really gonna
use that thing, Joe.

1142
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:47,722
You open those pressure
doors, this ship fills

1143
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:49,552
with water at a rate
so fucking fast

1144
00:55:49,553 --> 00:55:51,623
the liquid will cut your
bodies in two.

1145
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:52,556
Drop it!

1146
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,557
(ominous music)

1147
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:56,869
What, you just gonna
let Pickman die in there?

1148
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,561
Pickman's lost his fucking mind.

1149
00:55:58,562 --> 00:55:59,734
Don't you get it?

1150
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:02,219
This was his dream, to
see those creatures,

1151
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,980
those ancient sea gods.

1152
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:05,050
And if that's what he wants,

1153
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:07,224
I do not need to go
down with him.

1154
00:56:07,225 --> 00:56:09,779
He didn't even know these
things were down here.

1155
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,057
Pickman knew.

1156
00:56:12,196 --> 00:56:13,439
He knew what they were,

1157
00:56:14,232 --> 00:56:16,234
and he knew they were
only sleeping.

1158
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:19,514
(chuckles) Exactly.

1159
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:23,413
What do you think they
found down in Antarctica?

1160
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:25,070
What do you think they've
been searching

1161
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:26,416
for all these years?

1162
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:28,245
And he just let us wake them up.

1163
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:30,489
Pickman did not spend
all of this money

1164
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,974
for you two to have the
adventure of a lifetime.

1165
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:35,563
We were sent here with a
clear objective.

1166
00:56:35,564 --> 00:56:37,979
Get the tissue sample
from the fucking water goblins,

1167
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,325
make it back to the surface,

1168
00:56:39,326 --> 00:56:41,431
and get filthy, fucking rich.

1169
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:44,123
So will you please
both move away

1170
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:46,505
from the fucking pressure doors!

1171
00:56:46,506 --> 00:56:48,645
You think that specimen's
gonna make you rich?

1172
00:56:48,646 --> 00:56:49,991
It's gonna be harder
than you think.

1173
00:56:49,992 --> 00:56:53,029
Oh, you think I'm scared
of a couple of brainiacs?

1174
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,204
No, that thing is growing.

1175
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,448
You can go and look at it
if you don't believe me.

1176
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,588
And I think it's having a
strange psychological effect

1177
00:57:00,589 --> 00:57:01,521
on our crew.

1178
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:03,453
Oh, you fucking think.

1179
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,111
It doesn't just
exist physically,

1180
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:08,701
it's in our minds,
it's in our thoughts.

1181
00:57:09,736 --> 00:57:12,981
Joe, I don't know if
you know this,

1182
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:16,811
but I have a son waiting
for me back home.

1183
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:19,401
He's 10 months old, and if
I don't get back to him,

1184
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:22,679
if I don't see him again,

1185
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,061
I swear to fucking God,

1186
00:57:25,062 --> 00:57:26,856
you'll die down here with me,

1187
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,168
and it won't be pretty.

1188
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:32,033
I don't need to listen
to this bullshit.

1189
00:57:32,034 --> 00:57:34,346
(door hissing)

1190
00:57:34,347 --> 00:57:36,279
Wait, don't agitate him.

1191
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,729
- Jim!
- He's dangerous, Chris.

1192
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,214
There's nothing we can do.

1193
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:42,597
(ominous music)

1194
00:57:44,115 --> 00:57:47,773
(Gordon coughing and hissing)

1195
00:57:47,774 --> 00:57:52,675
(ominous music rising)
(ax rasps)

1196
00:57:52,676 --> 00:57:55,298
(eerie music)
(flesh squelching)

1197
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:58,474
(chains clanking)

1198
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,788
(Joe grunts and groans)

1199
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:11,488
(Joe moaning)
(bag rustling)

1200
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,147
(knife clanks)

1201
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:20,772
(knife rasping)
(Joe moans)

1202
00:58:20,773 --> 00:58:24,155
(eerie music continues)

1203
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:28,434
(bag rustling)

1204
00:58:28,435 --> 00:58:31,404
(flesh squelching)

1205
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,513
(ominous music)

1206
00:58:39,654 --> 00:58:41,689
(body crunching)

1207
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,001
Gordon?

1208
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:44,727
(Walt) <i>It's from the sea,</i>

1209
00:58:44,728 --> 00:58:48,145
<i>frozen in time and
waiting for the thaw.</i>

1210
00:58:49,629 --> 00:58:53,632
Jim, my boy, is it really you?

1211
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:55,116
Gordon, maybe you should
come downstairs

1212
00:58:55,117 --> 00:58:56,946
and lie down for a while.

1213
00:58:56,947 --> 00:58:59,777
I always knew you would
find me one day, Jimmy.

1214
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:03,262
They told me you would come,

1215
00:59:03,263 --> 00:59:08,405
but I prayed, I prayed
that it wasn't true.

1216
00:59:08,406 --> 00:59:12,133
(Gordon gagging)
(body cracking)

1217
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:14,584
Don't be afraid, Jimmy.

1218
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:17,863
Death is not the end.

1219
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:21,487
These are things I
should never have known,

1220
00:59:21,488 --> 00:59:24,526
things of nature never
intended us to find.

1221
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:28,011
Sit down, Gordon.
(Gordon gagging)

1222
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:29,634
I don't think that's
Gordon anymore.

1223
00:59:29,635 --> 00:59:32,671
Show them, Jimmy.
Show them the way home,

1224
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:35,812
back to their place
they once knew.

1225
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:40,853
(Gordon gagging)
(body crunching)

1226
00:59:41,129 --> 00:59:44,649
None of this insignificant race

1227
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:48,618
will know how I tried
to warn them,

1228
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,620
how they left it, too late.

1229
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:53,312
Get the fuck away from me,
Gordon.

1230
00:59:53,313 --> 00:59:54,520
Don't make me use this.

1231
00:59:54,521 --> 00:59:59,595
When they awake, it
is time for us to sleep.

1232
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,079
(Gordon screaming)
(body cracking)

1233
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,254
(head whooshing)
(ooze squelching)

1234
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:06,636
(tense suspenseful music)

1235
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:08,776
(both grunting)

1236
01:00:08,777 --> 01:00:11,468
(ooze squelching)

01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:14,127

01:00:18,062 --> 01:00:19,891
(tense suspenseful music rising)

1239
01:00:19,892 --> 01:00:22,618
(metal clanks)

1240
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,998
(Jim screams)

1241
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:26,243
Jim! (panting)

1242
01:00:28,279 --> 01:00:30,626
(suspenseful music)
(Gordon grunting)

1243
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,489
(ax thudding)

1244
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:33,490
Gordon!

1245
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:36,045
(alarm blaring)

1246
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:41,050
(ax thudding)
(Gordon grunting)

1247
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:44,363
(suspenseful music continues)

1248
01:00:44,364 --> 01:00:46,296
That's it, w-we've lost them.

1249
01:00:46,297 --> 01:00:48,575
I can't get a signal,
there's nothing.

1250
01:00:50,094 --> 01:00:55,099
(alarm blaring)
(suspenseful music continues)

1251
01:00:57,999 --> 01:01:00,241

(ax thudding)
(Gordon grunting)

1253
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:02,692
Gordon!

1254
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:05,178
(door hissing)

1255
01:01:06,524 --> 01:01:09,355

(alarm blaring continues)
(suspenseful music continues)

1257
01:01:13,704 --> 01:01:14,980
Move!

1258
01:01:14,981 --> 01:01:17,950
(gun firing)
(Gordon grunts)

1259
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:22,886
(tense music)

1260
01:01:24,404 --> 01:01:25,336
Gordon?

1261
01:01:25,337 --> 01:01:26,716
(Gordon growling)

1262
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:28,545
(ax clanks)
(alarm blaring continues)

1263
01:01:28,546 --> 01:01:29,615
What have you done?

1264
01:01:29,616 --> 01:01:31,479
(ooze squelching)

1265
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,760

(Joe grunts)
(gun firing)

1267
01:01:39,972 --> 01:01:42,732
(bullets thudding and clanking)

1268
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:45,770
Joe, stop, you'll
blow the windows!

1269
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:47,081
Joe, what are you doing?

1270
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:49,118
This thing's going down,
sweetheart,

1271
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,602
back down to the bottom
of the ocean,

1272
01:01:50,603 --> 01:01:52,880
only I'm not going down with it.

1273
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:54,502
You can't just leave
us to pilot this thing.

1274
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:55,711
Pilot what?

1275
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,782
It's scrap metal, lady,
open your fucking eyes!

1276
01:01:57,783 --> 01:01:59,956
This thing is going down!

1277
01:01:59,957 --> 01:02:02,614
(gun snaps)
(alarm blaring continues)

1278
01:02:02,615 --> 01:02:04,030
I'm sorry about your kid.

1279
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:06,445
(suspenseful music)

1280

(gun clanks)
(alarm blaring continues)

1284
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,051
Now you wanna fight me now, bitch.

1285
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:27,328
Try it.

1286
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:31,022
(both grunting)
(suspenseful music continues)

1287

(Joe laughing)
(suspenseful music continues)

1292
01:02:58,326 --> 01:03:00,637
You think we're just
gonna let you walk out

1293
01:03:00,638 --> 01:03:01,881
of here, bitch?

1294
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,814
No, I don't.

1295
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,505
(ax thuds)

1303
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:26,663

What?

1308

to stay behind to seal
the pressure lock.

1361

Go on without me.

Let's go together...

1411

Together with them into
the depths of oblivion.

Ms. Harris, can you hear me?

It's okay, you're safe.

1419

We're looking after you now.

Jim?

They've gone. Ms. Harris.

1423

After communication was lost,

1424
01:11:54,827 --> 01:11:57,139
we picked up your rover signal.

1425

Your oxygen levels were
dangerously low.

You've been unconscious
for a couple of days.

You killed them.

You knew exactly what we
were going into,

1430

you fucking knew that!
Ms. Harris, calm down!

Ms. Harris, please, relax!

1432

Please!
Neither of us got

1433

what we wanted, did we?

1434
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:18,022
You knew the risks.

1435
01:12:18,023 --> 01:12:19,920
No one must know what happened.

1436
01:12:19,921 --> 01:12:21,577
(screaming) Ahh!!!

1437
01:12:21,578 --> 01:12:23,614

No, no, no, no, no.

1444

No! (grunting)

1445
01:12:45,084 --> 01:12:47,879
Congratulations, bitch,
you got exactly

1446
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,881
